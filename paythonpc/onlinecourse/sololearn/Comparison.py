'''Comparison'''

print('annie'>'andry')
'''The first two characters from "Annie" and "Andy" (A and A)
 are compared. As they are equal, the second two characters are compared.
  Because they are also equal, the third two characters (n and d) are compared. 
  And because n has greater alphabetical order value than d, 
  "Annie" is greater than "Andy".'''
